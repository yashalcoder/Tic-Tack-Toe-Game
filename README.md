Game Description:
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game. 
Each player takes turns marking a space in a 3x3 grid. One player uses X and the other uses O.
The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

Game Rules:
Players:
    
    The game is played by two players.
    One player is designated as X, and the other player is O.
    Game Board:

The game board is a 3x3 grid.
Starting the Game:

    Players decide who goes first.
    Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in an empty cell.
Winning the Game:
    
    A player wins if they are the first to get three of their marks in a row.
    The three marks can be aligned horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Draw:
      
      The game is a draw if all cells are filled and no player has three marks in a row.
Detailed Rules:
Marking the Board:
    
    Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on the board.
    A mark can only be placed in an empty cell.
    Once placed, a mark cannot be moved.
Winning Conditions:
    
    A player wins if they have three of their marks in any of the following configurations:
    Horizontal: All three marks in the same row.
    Vertical: All three marks in the same column.
    Diagonal: All three marks in a diagonal line (from top-left to bottom-right or from top-right to bottom-left).
Draw Condition:
    
    The game is declared a draw if all 9 cells are filled with no player achieving a winning configuration.
Invalid Moves:
 
    If a player attempts to place a mark in an already occupied cell, it is considered an invalid move, and they must choose a different cell.
Game End:
     The game ends as soon as a player wins or if it is declared a draw.
     If a player wins, the game does not continue; the winning condition takes priority over filling the remaining cells.
